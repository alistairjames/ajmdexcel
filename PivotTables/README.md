## EvidencePivotTable
This very simple pivot table is intended as a comparison to the pivot table generated by the code in ajmdpython/PandasPivotTables.  

While both tables are essentially the same, the tables generated in Python Pandas take a bit more effort, but can be fitted more easily into an overall analysis running scripts that generate and export the pivot tables.
